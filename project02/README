This project will make movie recommendations based upon collected data and user preferences.

Recommendations.py:
	*sim_distance(prefs,person1,person2)- Will calculate the euclidian distance between all movies ranked by both person and person 2. Returns how similar they are

	*sim_pearson(prefs,person1,person2)- Close to the sim_distance function. Will return the pearson similarity metric for person 1 and 2 based on movies they have both seen

	*topMatches(prefs, person, n=5, similarity=sim_pearson)= will return the top matches for that person

	*getRecommendations(prefs,person,similarity=sim_pearson)- will return sorted recommendations for that person. Uses pearson unless changed to euclidian

	*transformPrefs(prefs)-invert preferences so that you can see who and what ranking everyone gave a certain movie

	*calculateSimilarItems(prefs,n=10)- calculates similarity for a set of preferences

	*getRecommendedItems(prefs,itemMatch,user)- This will return a sorted list (highest chance of person liking it) first on down for a given user

	*loadMovieLens(path='/data/movielens')- This will load the lens dataset from the university of michigan


deliciousrec.py:
	* initializeUserDict(tag, count=5)-this will get a dictionary of the last 30 people to post to the website

	*fillItems(user_dict)- This will fill the dictionary that is passed in
